# Patient-Record-Holder.P1

One Paragraph of the project description

This project consist of two parts, the user input which is the "patient" and then the print which
will print the given in a specific order at which its created. It contains plenty of prints and scanners
that helps identify the inputs, as well as global identifiers to help with seperation of classes
and readability. Error checks are apart of the project as well as medical records need proper filling of information to 
be in record properly. 

## Getting Started

This is running on my local maching for coding and a school vpn for testing and quality assurance.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 

VS Code; used for coding and debugging of code errors (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

MobaXTerm; used to deploy the code on school vpn not needed just need to test in school environment to ensure grader has smooth running of code (https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/).

Compiler GNU GCC; (https://gcc.gnu.org/).

### Installing

When installing the VS Code, ensure you have the extensions for C and C+ as they are needed to run properly on VS Code,
they can be located on the left hand side of the application once launched.

If additional help is needed, would recommend this video for help on extensions.

Secondly, while MobaXTerm isn't needed, you can use that coding environment as well to make sure it could run on another system via vpn.

Lastly, I downloaded GCC GNU at the time, I used GNU version 10.4 in the compilation of the project.

Once installations are completed, run the program and should ask for some user inputs, which if runned correctly you should be able to enter information that it is asking for. 

For example; *Sample Test*



### Sample Tests

"Enter your state" after entering your city name, but before entering your zipcode. 
This is paramount as you want the information being given to be consistent with an actual patient medical record. 


### Style test

While I don't use a specific coding style I believe staying true to a specific style of coding would really help with the flow of code and productivity.

For example; a coding style that could be used to make the code more readable as, (at least in my opinion) could be more readable to the users. 


## Deployment

While its a local machine, you can still deploy on a vpn and no automation is present as you manually have to enter the information.
