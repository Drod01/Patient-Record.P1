##Patient-Record-Keeper README
This repository contains code that demonstrates various functionalities related to handling user information and input validation. The code is written in C programming language and is designed to be run in a console environment.

##Getting Started
To get started with the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
2. Build and Run: Use the provided Makefile to build the code and generate an executable file. Run the executable in a console environment to interact with the code and test its features.

## Description
The code in this repository provides a set of functions to handle user information and perform input validation. It allows users to enter various details such as name, address, phone number, and more. The code ensures that the input meets specific criteria and provides appropriate feedback in case of errors or invalid input.

## Usage
To use the code, follow the prompts displayed in the console. The code will ask you to enter different types of information, such as first name, last name, address, phone number, and more. It will validate the input and provide feedback based on the validation results. Follow the instructions provided by the code to enter the required information accurately.

## Example
Here's an example of how to use the code:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open a console or terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Build the code using the provided Makefile. Execute the following command:

go
make

4. The Makefile will compile the code and generate an executable file named project2. Run the executable by executing the following command:

bash
./project2

5. The code will display prompts for entering various details. Follow the instructions and provide the required information. For example:

mathematica
Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Enter your address: 123 Main Street
Enter your phone number: 555-1234

6. The code will validate the input and provide feedback accordingly. If there are any errors or invalid input, it will display an appropriate error message. For example:

less
Input error: Invalid phone number format. Please enter a valid phone number.

7. Continue following the prompts and provide the required information until the code execution is complete.

## Makefile
The provided Makefile simplifies the build process for the code. It has the following targets:

make: This is the default target and is used to build the code. It compiles the source file project2.c and generates an executable file named project2.
make clean: This target cleans the project directory by removing the generated executable file and object files.


Here's the content of the Makefile:

makefile

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -g -Wall -std=c99
OBJECTS = project2.c
NAME = project2
TODELETE = $(NAME) *.o

project2 : $(OBJECTS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) -o $(NAME)

.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -f $(TODELETE)
    
## Dependencies
The code has the following dependencies:

Standard C Library: The code relies on standard C library functions for string manipulation, input/output operations, and memory management.
